        <h5>Revalidation Appraisals</h5>
        <div>
          <p>
            We are pleased to announce that we have been awarded designated body
            status. One of our statutory responsibilities as a designated body
            is to appoint a Responsible Officer. Our Responsible Officer is Dr
            Ian Grant, a Consultant Haematologist. Dr Grant is ultimately
            responsible for the revalidation of Doctors who have a prescribed
            connection to Intevia Healthcare.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have also appointed Healthcare Licensing Support Ltd (HLS), an
            independent organisation who work with Dr Grant, to manage the
            appraisal and revalidation service for our locum Doctors. All
            Doctors with a UK licence to practice must participate in an annual
            appraisal and are subject to the revalidation process at year 5.
            <br />
            <br />
            HLS Ltd have a wealth of knowledge and expertise in this field and
            have processes in place to support you with your appraisals and
            revalidation. They can also appraise Doctors without a connection to
            a designated body.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h5>Purpose of revalidation</h5>
          <p>
            The purpose of Revalidation is to ensure that medical professionals
            are keeping up to date with their chosen field or specialty to
            ensure safe and effective practice. This means that medical
            practitioners can be confident in providing the highest level of
            care to their patients, which in turn assists with their career
            development and delivery.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since December 2012, it has been a mandatory requirement for every
            doctor with a licence to practice in the UK to engage in the
            Revalidation process.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since April 2016, it will be the new process for Nurses and Midwives
            in the UK. Revalidation is straightforward and will help you as a
            nurse or midwife demonstrate that you practise safely and
            effectively. It will encourage you to reflect on the role of the
            Code in your practice and demonstrate that you are ‘living’ the
            standards set out within it.
            <br />
            <br />
            This new process replaces the Prep requirements, and you will have
            to revalidate every three years as a nurse or midwife to renew your
            registration.
            <br />
            <br />
            Intevia Healthcare has dedicated Revalidation teams to guide locum
            doctors and nurses/ midwives through every step of Revalidation.
            <em>
              Every doctor with a GMC licence to practice in the UK is expected
              to revalidate once every 5 years. In order to prepare for
              revalidation, the GMC requires you to:

            <li>1. Participate in a yearly appraisal</li>
            <li>
              2. Collect feedback from colleagues and patients once in each
              revalidation cycle <br />
              <br />
              All nurses and midwives with a NMC licence in the UK is expected
              to revalidate once every 3 years. In order to prepare for
              revalidation, the NMC requires you to:

          <p>
            Intevia Healthcare is here to help with locum Revalidation,
            providing a first-class Revalidation support service to doctors and
            nurses/midwives.
            <br />
            <br />
            Revalidation will provide benefits for you as a doctor or nurse or
            midwife as well as the people you care for. It will help to
            encourage a culture of sharing, reflection and improvement and will
            be an ongoing process throughout your career.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is important to know that revalidation is not about making an
            assessment of your fitness to practise; it is about promoting good
            practice across the whole population of doctors and nurses and
            midwives, as well as strengthening public confidence in the medical
            or nursing and midwifery professions.
